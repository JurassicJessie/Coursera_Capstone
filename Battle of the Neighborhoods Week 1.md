# Battle of the Neighborhoods Week 1 Final Project

## Introduction/Business Problem

  E-sports (competition using video games) has become more popular than ever. Video game bars (or cafes) 
  can be a great place for people whom are interested in competing professionally or casually to congregate and socialize.
  They are also a great place to host organized competitions.
  
  In this project, we will help an investor decide the best location within the city of Toronto to open a video game bar.
